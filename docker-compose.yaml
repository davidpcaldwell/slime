  # Produces a stateful, persistent SLIME container that begins as a blank box with the source directory mounted. Local changes
  # (to the local/ subdirectory, like installing JDKs, Rhino, Tomcat, and so forth) will persist between runs.
  #
  # Also used by the devcontainer implementation.
  #
  # The primary user interface for the container is the novnc interface, which can be reached at http://localhost:7902/vnc.html.
  # The chrome and firefox services are still started so that the container can emulate the CI tests for debugging CI-only failures
  # via the contributor/devcomtainer/check script.
