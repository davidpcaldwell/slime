/**
 * **Fifty** is an authoring framework for SLIME _definitions_: constructs containing both documentation and tests.
 *
 * ## Fifty definitions: authoring documentation
 *
 * Fifty uses the {@link https://tsdoc.org/ | TSDoc } documentation format, and its results are published using
 * {@link https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc | TypeDoc }.
 *
 * ## Fifty definitions: authoring tests
 *
 * Fifty provides an API for {@link slime.fifty.test | authoring tests} right in the middle of TypeScript definitions.
 *
 * ## Serving documentation: `fifty view`
 *
 * Fifty also allows SLIME-based projects to generate and serve their own documentation (interleaved with SLIME's, if SLIME is
 * included in the TypeScript project) via the `fifty view` command.
 *
 * `fifty view` serves the documentation for a project, in a dedicated Chrome browser if Chrome is found. Typedoc documentation will
 * be generated if necessary and served for both the top-level repository and subrepositories at `local/doc/typedoc` (it will be
 * re-generated for each request if `--watch` is used).
 *
 * *  `--base *directory*`: top-level directory of the project; defaults to the current working directory.
 * *  `--host *hostname*`: hostname suffix to use in the browser's address bar when serving pages. If omitted, the script will provide a host name.
 * * `--index *path*`: relative path to the index page; defaults to `README.html`.
 * *  `--watch`: if present, causes documentation to be re-generated for every HTML page requested; helpful when authoring docunmentation.
 * *  `--chrome:id *name*`: the private Chrome directory to use (under `local/chrome`); defaults to `documentation`, or `document` if `--watch` is set).
 *
 * ### Embedding `fifty view`
 *
 * Some projects might benefit from a more flexible Fifty UI; an alternative to `fifty view` is to embed its documentation in a
 * SLIME application. The following APIs can be used as building blocks:
 *
 * * The {@link slime.tools.documentation | Documentation API } provides a SLIME servlet handler implementation that serves
 * documentation.
 * * The {@link slime.jsh.Global#ui | `jsh.ui`} API provides the ablity to launch SLIME applications with a UI, and can incorporate the
 * documentation servlet handler implementation defined above.
