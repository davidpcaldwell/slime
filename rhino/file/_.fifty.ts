 * The {@link slime.jrunscript.file.World} interface, available as the `world` property of
 * {@link slime.jrunscript.file.Exports | Exports}, provides a world-oriented interface to filesystems, beginning with the
 * `filesystems.os` property, providing a {@link slime.jrunscript.file.world.Filesystem} implementation which provides a
 * world-oriented API for accessing the host filesystem.
