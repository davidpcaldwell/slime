 * Provides access to filesystems.

 * ## World-oriented implementation
 *
 * The {@link slime.jrunscript.file.Exports | Location} and {@link slime.jrunscript.file.Exports | filesystems} properties exported
 * by the module provide a world-oriented interface to filesystems, beginning with the `filesystems.os` property, which provides a
 * {@link slime.jrunscript.file.world.Filesystem} implementation which provides a world-oriented API for accessing the host
 * filesystem.
