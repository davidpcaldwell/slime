		SLIME WebView application run inside an embedded JavaFX browser derived from WebKit.
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>SLIME Browser</h1>
		<div>
			The browser is provided with an implementation of <code>alert</code> that routes messages back to the containing
			program.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1><code>webview.initialize.js</code></h1>
		<div>
			If the page inside the browser executes a script named <code>window.initialize.js</code>, the
			page will conditionally load additional features to allow enhanced
			communication between the page and the embedding process. This script can safely be used in an
			application that is compatible with running inside or outside WebView, as loading it in an ordinary
			browser will have no effect.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>window.console</h2>
			<div>
				The browser is provided with a console that routes messages back to the containing program.
			</div>
