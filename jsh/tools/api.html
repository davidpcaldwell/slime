		<div>
			Creates a <i>Slime</i> file.
		</div>
		<div>
			A Slime file contains JavaScript code. It can also contain supporting Java classes that will be made available to the
			JavaScript code.
		</div>
		<div>
			Usage:
			<blockquote><code>slime.jsh.js -from &lt;source-directory> -to &lt;destination-path></code></blockquote>
		</div>
		<div>
			The <code>source-directory</code> should be a directory containing scripts. It can also contain Java source code in
			a <code>java</code> subdirectory; all <code>.java</code> files under that directory will be compiled and their classes
			will be added to the Slime file.
		</div>
		<div>
			The <code>destination-path</code> can be any path, but it is recommended that it use the <code>.slime</code> file
			extension, as some other components (the jsh plugin architecture, for example) detect Slime files using that
			extension.
