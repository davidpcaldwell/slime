# The Specification Editor is obsolete

This was an effort to build an authoring tool for `jsapi` definitions, but `jsapi` definitions have been superseded by Fiffy
definitions, so this tool is obsolete. It is still in the codebase pending harvesting of anything useful from it; see
[issue #279](https://github.com/davidpcaldwell/slime/issues/279).
